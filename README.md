## The master plan pipeline

- [ ] save tree in Tree object
- [ ] save path Tree to a file
- [ ] identify duplicate name files
- [ ] pick a duplicate file name from path Tree and print its [diffs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html)
- [ ] Save diffs to a file, e.g. a Google Sheet for ease of analyzing.
- [ ] automate this
